🧠 Causal Meal Recommender System
This project builds a personalized meal recommendation system that goes beyond traditional recommender models by estimating causal effects of meal plans on individual health outcomes. Using simulated health data and causal inference techniques (e.g., T-learners, Causal Forests), the system predicts how different diet types affect users based on their BMI, medical conditions, and lifestyle.

It also includes an LLM-powered chatbot that interacts with users, provides meal suggestions, and explains the reasoning behind each recommendation — making the system both intelligent and interpretable.

Core Components:

🧪 Synthetic dataset simulating user health profiles and dietary interventions

🔍 Recommender system baseline (collaborative filtering)

🎯 Causal ML models for estimating treatment effects (EconML, DoWhy)

💬 Interactive chatbot frontend (Streamlit or Gradio + LLM)
